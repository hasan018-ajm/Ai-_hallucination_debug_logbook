### ‚úÖ Entry #VBC-13x-AI-001

- **AI Output:**  
  > "The moon has no gravity, which is why astronauts could float easily there."

- **Issue Type:**  
  Physical Misrepresentation + Oversimplification

- **Analysis:**  
  The AI incorrectly stated that the Moon has no gravity, when in fact it has ~1/6th of Earth's gravity. It also implied that astronauts float easily, which ignores the physical effort and training required for lunar movement.

- **Correction Insight:**
  - The Moon does have gravity.
  - Astronauts train intensively to adapt to its reduced gravitational pull.
  - ‚ÄúFloating‚Äù is not effortless‚Äîit‚Äôs a complex balance of motion and control.

- **Tags:**  
  `#MoonGravityFallacy` `#PerceptionVsReality` `#AIHallucination`
